# Asteroids

The classic arcade shooter Asteroids with a Star Wars theme because, why not? Created quickly because I wanted a fun project to practice HTML5/Canvas, and designing physics logic (movement, rotation, friction, collision detection, etc).

## Controls
* Shoot with **space**
* Move with **WAD** or **arrow** keys.


## Future Improvements
* Pause
* Toggle music
* Explosions
* Bigger asteroids take multiple hits
* Improved difficulty progression
* Upgrades store (faster shooting, acceleration, power ups)
