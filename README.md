![asteroids]

The classic arcade shooter Asteroids with a Star Wars theme because, why not? Created quickly because I wanted a fun project to practice HTML5/Canvas, and designing physics logic (movement, rotation, friction, collision detection, etc).

## Controls

![newgame]

* Shoot with **space**
* Move with **wad** or **arrow** keys
* **p** to pause and enter upgrade store
* **m** to toggle music

## Upgrades

![store]

Upgrades can be purchased with points. Current upgrades in the store are:
* Invincibility (3 seconds)
* Faster reload
* Faster ship speed
* Extra life

## Future Improvements
* Explosions
* Bigger asteroids take multiple hits
* Improved difficulty progression

### Note on friction/sound in space
I chose to add friction to my Asteroids game because it made moving the ship more intuitive to me. Similarly, the Star Wars OST is awesome so my space has music.
